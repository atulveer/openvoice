TropoVoice is an Open Source project.
It uses Voxeo's Tropo platform to build a communication platform for consumer as well as enterprise.
It intends to support voice, SMS, IM, skype, SIP, and iNum.
I will add implemented features as the code grows.

Setup your development environment
Create a tropo app first and get your own phone numbers and IMs
Clone this project and start the rails server on your local machine
Highly recommend use rake tunnel:tunnel:start to reverse tunnel to your local machine for faster development.  Please don't use my tunnlr credential.

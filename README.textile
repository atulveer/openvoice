OpenVoice is a light-weight, open-source web framework enabling developers to write GoogleVoice-like applications
using RESTful APIs. Thanks to Ruby-on-Rails and Tropo, developers can create next generation telephony applications
quickly. Under the hood, OpenVoice handles call routing/forwarding, voicemails services including transcription,
SIP/Skype support, and IM/SMS  support. Some notable differences from GoogleVoice are: open-source, API support,
and SIP/Skype support where GoogleVoice only supports Gizmo.

OpenVoice is built on top of Tropo, it can be deployed onto any server because it is a Rails application. In the future
OpenVoice plans to support other backends such as FreeSwitch. On the client side, OpenVoice supports Android and will
support Flash phone.

== To create an OpenVoice account:

First go to http://openvoice.heroku.com/users/new to create a new login.

Then you need to create a tropo application.  Go to tropo.com and sign up for a free developer's account.
Create a tropo application and make it look like this:
http://idisk.me.com/zlu/Public/Pictures/Skitch/Tropo.com-20100609-082358.jpg
If you use my OpenVoice server at http://openvoice.heroku.com, then the url for voice call should be:
http://openvoice.heroku.com/communications/index?format=json
And the url for messaging is:
http://openvoice.heroku.com/messagings/create?format=json
If you deploy openvoice on your own server, then replace the server url to your own.

Once you obtain all the tropo information, then goto openvoice.heroku.com, log in, and go to profile to create a new profile.
Your prfoile should look like this but with your own tropo information
http://idisk.me.com/zlu/Public/Pictures/Skitch/OpenVoice_-_profiles_index-20100609-082551.jpg
then you can add a forwarding/default number at the phone number page.

Please keep in mind that this openvoice server is under active developement thus in no way stable.  If you want stability,
deploy the code on your own server.

If you find bugs, please log them in the issues section on github.

== To setup your development environment:

Create a tropo app first and get your own phone numbers and IMs
Clone this project and start the rails server on your local machine
Highly recommend use rake tunnel:tunnel:start to reverse tunnel to your local machine for faster development.
You can either setup your own reverse ssh tunnel or get one from tunnlr.com.
Please don't use my tunnlr credential.
